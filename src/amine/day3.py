### TensorFlow is a powerful open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. 
## It enables building and training neural networks efficiently, 
##using optimized tensor computations. 
## It supports CPU, GPU, and TPU acceleration, making it ideal for complex AI models.

#Keras is a high-level neural network API that runs on top of TensorFlow. 
#It provides an easy-to-use interface for defining deep learning models without needing complex implementations.
#TensorFlow integrates Keras natively, making it ideal for rapid AI development.

# * Output layer is activated with softmax
# * As input, we consider the pixels directly -- we'll look later into using engineered features
